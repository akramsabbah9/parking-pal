# parking-pal

ParkingPal connects Providers who want to rent their parking spaces to Consumers who are looking for spaces near their location. When logged into the app, a user can both provide their parking spots or rent out a spot from another user.

When providing a space, a user can add their parking space details, prices and date(s) available. When looking for a space to rent, a user can search for parking by location, and make a reservation to rent a space via stripe transaction.
